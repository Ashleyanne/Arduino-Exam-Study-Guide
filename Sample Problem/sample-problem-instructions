Sample Problem

Examples of demonstration tasks might include:

1. Reverse the order of the LEDs when they turn off. 
2. Add a button press to the code so that the LEDs only start once the button is pressed. 
3. I might remove part of the code, like the declaration or the delay, and ask you to troubleshoot it.
